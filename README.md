# 8086 Disassembler-Assembler
Disassembler &amp; Assembler in ASM

"Asembley Language is a low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions."

An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations. while a disassembler is a computer program that translates machine language into assembly languageâ€”the inverse operation to that of an assembler. A disassembler differs from a decompiler, which targets a high-level language rather than an assembly language.

Here an assembler and a disassembler for the 8086 Assembely language introduced. Both programes are writen in the 8086 Assembly language.
These two programs can undrestand and interpret the following instructions:

mov,	add,	adc,	sub,	sbb,
and,	or,	xor,	dec,	inc,
cmp,	test,	xchg,	xadd,	
imul,	idiv,			
bsf,	bsr,			
stc,	clc,	std,	cld,	
shl,	shr,	neg,	not,	
call,	ret,	syscall,	push,	pop.

> warning: There are some bugs in interpreting in some cases.
